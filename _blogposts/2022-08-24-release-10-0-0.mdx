** Introduction **

ReScript is a soundly typed language with an optimizing compiler focused on the JS platform.
It's focused on type safety, performance and JS interop.

[ReScript@10.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rescript/v/10.0.0) is now available for testing, you can try it via

```
npm i rescript@10.0.0
```

The detailed changes are listed [here](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/blob/10.0_release/CHANGELOG.md).

** Upgrade guide **

Please see the detailed [changelog](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/blob/10.0_release/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of breaking changes.
Each breaking change lists suggestions on how to upgrade your project.
This can be out of your control in case of dependencies. In that case, please raise issues with the maintainers of those libraries.

One special word for PPXs, in particular for PPX authors. As mentioned in the changelog, some PPXs may give an error `"Attributes not allowed here"`. The solution is to adapt the PPXs following the example of `rescript-relay` in https://github.com/zth/rescript-relay/pull/372.

** What's next **

The 10.0 release contains the changes (including breaking) and bug fixes to the compiler from the last year or so. This will be followed by release 10.1 which will contain the new features enabled by this, ranging from native support for async/await, to the new V4 version of JSX.
